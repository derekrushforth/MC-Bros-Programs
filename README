These programs can be used on computers in the ComputerCraft mod for minecraft.
They are being designed to make manual mining a thing of the past. They are
included by default on all new computers created on the mcbros server at
dplusc.mine.nu:25566.

A startup file is also included to define easy to use aliases for all the
programs.
